**Today's Progress**: Chef, Worked on chef kitchen functionality for the Cookbooks.

**Thoughts:** I have worked on Chef kitchen earliar, it was working fine. Somehow the same code is not working. I really struggled with windows, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: June 02, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
